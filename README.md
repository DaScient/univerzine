# ✦ Univerzine ✦  
**Your latest and greatest in tech, science, big data, and beyond**

Univerzine is not a website.  
It’s a **cosmic, interactive magazine** — a living field of particles, gravity wells, neon constellations, and ideas.

A place where articles don’t scroll…  
they **exist in space**.

## ✨ What is Univerzine?

**Univerzine** is an experimental, browser-native platform that blends:

- Interactive journalism  
- Real-time cosmic simulations  
- Magazine-style storytelling  
- Immersive motion & spatial navigation  

All rendered directly in the browser using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.

No installs.  
No logins.  
Just drift.

## 🌌 Core Experience

- **Living cosmic field**  
  Particles, galaxies, nebulae, wormholes, and gravitational anomalies evolve in real time.

- **Retro-futurist neon centerpiece**  
  A glowing, drive-in–style electro-sign radiates from the center of the universe:  
  **“Welcome to Univerzine!”**  
  (pink, purple, electric baby blue, pastel neon glow)

- **Magazine-as-a-universe**  
  Articles are not pages — they are *locations*.  
  Fly toward stories. Enter them. Leave orbit when you’re done.

- **Motion-aware navigation**  
  - Gyroscope controls camera orientation  
  - Device movement influences spatial drift  
  - Optional geolocation subtly maps your real-world position into cosmic motion

- **Single-screen immersive mode**  
  No split-screen VR.  
  One uninterrupted viewport — your device becomes the window.

## 🧪 Local Exploration

You can open `index.html` directly, but for best results use a local server:

### Python
```bash
python3 -m http.server 8080

Node

npx serve .

Then navigate to:

http://localhost:8080
```


📁 Repo Structure
	•	index.html — the universe itself
	•	.nojekyll — disables Jekyll/Liquid (important)
	•	assets/ — visuals, icons, previews (optional)
	•	README.md — this document
	•	LICENSE — MIT


🧭 Philosophy

Univerzine treats information as terrain, not text.

You don’t scroll knowledge.
You enter it.

The universe doesn’t ask for attention —
it rewards curiosity.
